Brownian Motion sim:
    particles.js:
        - Particles of different sizes seem to collide at a distance before actual
          collision. Only in JS and not seen in pygame. 

        FIX: this is because big particles make circle of their radius around them, and if small particles enter that, considered a collision.
        Need a second verification AFTER collision detected, comparing particle radii
