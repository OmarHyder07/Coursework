NLP refinement
NLP extract data (regex...)
--particle collisions done by quadtree--
test with NLP --> pygame simulation
webapp UI 
new db created on startup
db holds previous messages
option to go back into previous prompts (storing all data in db)
input --> NLP --> physics
--every 50ms send simulation data to front end--
--animation in JS?--


next sims to do:
    Particle projection 

change from stream to websocket so can send:
window size, new prompts etc.

1: change from stream to websocket
2: have window sizing dynamically changed. 
3: fully do analysis.
4: clean up main flask python file (thing where can have multiple files)
