NLP refinement
NLP extract data (regex...)
--particle collisions done by quadtree--
test with NLP --> pygame simulation
webapp UI 
new db created on startup
db holds previous messages
option to go back into previous prompts (storing all data in db)
input --> NLP --> physics
--every 50ms send simulation data to front end--
--animation in JS?--


change from stream to websocket so can send:
window size, new prompts etc.

0: dunder methods for particle sim
1: change from stream to websocket
2: extract data (specifically for BMOTION)
3: work on GUI as a springboard into other simulations 
4: report 
5: clean code --> version 2


next sims to do:
    Particle projection
