NLP refinement
NLP extract data (regex...)
particle collisions done by quadtree
test with NLP --> pygame simulation
webapp UI 
new db created on startup
db holds previous messages
option to go back into previous prompts (storing all data in db)
input --> NLP --> physics
every 50ms send simulation data to front end
animation in JS? 

1: JS animation (example on quadtree video)
2: link python simulation data to JS animation
3: extract simulation data out of input sentance 
4: link extracted data to simulation (JUST BMOTION FOR NOW, SHM AND PROJECTION WILL RETURN A TBD MESSAGE)
